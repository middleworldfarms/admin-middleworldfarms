**Title:** Unable to Generate OAuth2 Private Keys - "Directory is not a valid directory" Error

Hi FarmOS team,

I'm having trouble configuring OAuth2 authentication for API access and could really use your help. I'm trying to integrate our FarmOS instance with a Laravel admin dashboard but getting stuck on the OAuth2 private key generation.

### Our Setup:
- **FarmOS URL**: https://farmos.middleworldfarms.org
- **Environment**: Plesk hosting environment on Linux
- **Web Server**: Nginx with www-data user
- **OAuth Consumer**: Already created successfully with client_id `Qw7!pZ2rT9@xL6vB1#eF4sG8uJ0mN5cD`
- **Goal**: Authenticate with farmOS API to retrieve land asset geometry data

### The Problem:
When trying to generate OAuth2 private keys in **Configuration > Web Services > Consumers > Settings**, FarmOS rejects every directory path I try with the error:

```
Directory "/path/to/directory" is not a valid directory.
```

### Directories I've Tested:
All of these directories exist, have proper www-data ownership (755/644 permissions), and are writable:

1. `/tmp/oauth-keys`
2. `/tmp/farmos-oauth-keys` 
3. `/opt/sites/keys`
4. `/var/oauth-keys`
5. `/opt/sites/farmos.middleworldfarms.org/sites/default/files/private/oauth`

I've verified each directory exists and is writable by the web server:
```bash
# All directories created with:
sudo mkdir -p /path/to/directory
sudo chown www-data:www-data /path/to/directory
sudo chmod 755 /path/to/directory

# Tested write access:
sudo -u www-data touch /path/to/directory/test.txt  # Works fine
```

### Current API Status:
Interestingly, our OAuth consumer IS being recognized by the API:

```bash
curl "https://farmos.middleworldfarms.org/api/asset/land"
```

Returns:
- ✅ HTTP 200 OK
- ✅ `X-Consumer-ID: Qw7!pZ2rT9@xL6vB1#eF4sG8uJ0mN5cD` header present
- ✅ Land assets detected but "insufficient authorization" (expected without OAuth token)

However, OAuth token requests fail:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://farmos.middleworldfarms.org/oauth/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d 'grant_type=password&username=martin@middleworldfarms.org&password=PASSWORD&client_id=Qw7!pZ2rT9@xL6vB1#eF4sG8uJ0mN5cD&client_secret=SECRET'
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "error": "server_error",
  "error_description": "You need to set the OAuth2 private key."
}
```

### Questions:
1. **What directory path format does FarmOS expect?** Is there a specific structure or naming convention?

2. **Are there file system permissions beyond standard www-data ownership** that FarmOS requires?

3. **Is there a way to manually configure the OAuth2 private key paths** in configuration files rather than through the UI?

4. **Could this be related to Plesk hosting environment** or any PHP security settings?

5. **Are there any logs** I can check to see why the directory validation is failing?

### Environment Details:
- PHP version: 8.2.28
- Drupal version: 10
- Simple OAuth module (latest version)
- FarmOS (latest version)

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated! The OAuth consumer setup is working, but we're blocked on the private key generation step.

Thanks in advance for your help!

### Additional Context:
This is for integrating farmOS with a Laravel admin dashboard to display farm geometry on interactive maps for delivery route planning. We've successfully connected to other APIs but farmOS's OAuth setup is proving challenging.
