# üö® CRITICAL: THIS IS A LIVE PRODUCTION SITE üö®

## ALWAYS REMEMBER:
- **Site URL**: https://admin.middleworldfarms.org:8444/admin/
- **Port**: 8444 (NOT 8000!)
- **Environment**: LIVE PRODUCTION (NOT local development)
- **Path**: /opt/sites/admin.middleworldfarms.org
- **Owner**: devuser (NOT root)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER DO THESE THINGS:
- ‚ùå Start `php artisan serve` (this is LIVE, not local)
- ‚ùå Use port 8000 (live site uses 8444)
- ‚ùå Assume this is local development
- ‚ùå Run development servers

## ‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH:
- ‚úÖ All file changes are immediately LIVE
- ‚úÖ Test at https://admin.middleworldfarms.org:8444/admin/
- ‚úÖ Be careful with changes - they affect production immediately
- ‚úÖ Remember: This is a functioning business system
