# Succession Planning System - Complete Instructions

## Overview

The Succession Planning System is a revolutionary backward-planning tool for farmOS that enables intelligent crop succession management with real-time bed allocation, seasonal growth adjustments, and seamless quick-form integration.

## Core Features

### üß† Intelligent Seasonal Planning
The system automatically adjusts succession timing based on seasonal growing conditions:

- **Spring Harvests (Mar-Jun)**: 2-week sowing intervals with accelerating growth rates (each succession 10% faster)
- **Autumn Harvests (Aug-Nov)**: 1-week sowing intervals with decelerating growth rates (each succession 15% slower)
- **Summer/Winter**: 1.5-week intervals with moderate growth adjustments

### üéØ Backward Planning Logic
- Start with desired harvest window
- System calculates optimal sowing dates based on seasonal growth patterns
- Each succession maintains appropriate spacing for continuous harvest flow

### üè° Real-Time Bed Allocation
- Visual drag-and-drop interface for assigning successions to beds
- Automatic conflict detection with existing farmOS plantings
- Timeline visualization showing bed occupancy and succession blocks

### üìù Quick Form Integration
- One-click generation of farmOS quick forms for seeding, transplanting, and harvesting
- Pre-populated with calculated dates and succession metadata
- Direct links to farmOS data entry

## How to Use

### 1. Access the Succession Planner
Navigate to `/admin/farmos/succession-planning` in your farmOS admin interface.

### 2. Configure Your Plan
- **Crop Selection**: Choose crop type and variety from farmOS taxonomy
- **Harvest Window**: Set desired harvest start and end dates
- **Succession Count**: Specify number of successions (auto-calculated based on window)
- **AI Enhancement**: Enable AI analysis for optimal timing recommendations

### 3. Generate Successions
Click "Calculate Succession Plan" to generate:
- Seasonally-adjusted sowing dates
- Transplant timing (if applicable)
- Harvest dates with proper spacing
- Bed allocation recommendations

### 4. Allocate to Beds
- Drag succession cards from the sidebar to bed timelines
- System prevents conflicts with existing plantings
- Visual feedback shows valid/invalid drop zones
- Auto-updates succession status and generates quick form URLs

### 5. Execute with Quick Forms
- Each allocated succession generates three quick form URLs:
  - **Seeding**: Record sowing date and details
  - **Transplanting**: Track transplant operations
  - **Harvesting**: Log harvest data and yields

## Seasonal Logic Details

### Spring Succession Pattern
```
Succession 1: Sow early ‚Üí Fast growth (45 days) ‚Üí Harvest first
Succession 2: Sow +2 weeks ‚Üí 10% faster (40 days) ‚Üí Harvest +2 weeks
Succession 3: Sow +4 weeks ‚Üí 20% faster (36 days) ‚Üí Harvest +4 weeks
```
*Result*: Wider sowing spacing with accelerating harvests maintains continuous supply

### Autumn Succession Pattern
```
Succession 1: Sow early ‚Üí Slow growth (45 days) ‚Üí Harvest first
Succession 2: Sow +1 week ‚Üí 15% slower (52 days) ‚Üí Harvest +1 week
Succession 3: Sow +2 weeks ‚Üí 30% slower (60 days) ‚Üí Harvest +2 weeks
Succession 4: Sow +3 weeks ‚Üí 45% slower (69 days) ‚Üí Harvest +3 weeks
```
*Result*: Closer sowing spacing with decelerating growth creates evenly-spaced harvests despite cooling conditions

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components
- **SuccessionPlanningController**: Main calculation engine
- **FarmOSApi**: Real-time bed data and conflict detection
- **SymbiosisAIService**: AI-enhanced planning recommendations
- **FarmOSQuickFormService**: URL generation and form integration

### Frontend Components
- **succession-planning.blade.php**: Main interface
- **Drag-and-drop API**: Native HTML5 with conflict validation
- **Timeline visualization**: SVG-based bed occupancy display
- **Real-time updates**: AJAX-powered bed allocation tracking

### Data Flow
1. User inputs ‚Üí Controller validation ‚Üí Seasonal calculations
2. FarmOS API queries ‚Üí Bed availability assessment
3. AI analysis (optional) ‚Üí Timing optimizations
4. Frontend rendering ‚Üí Drag-and-drop initialization
5. Allocation updates ‚Üí Quick form URL generation

## Troubleshooting

### Drag-and-Drop Not Working
**Issue**: Can't drag successions to timeline initially
**Solution**: Ensure succession plan is calculated first, then drag-and-drop initializes automatically

**Issue**: Dragging works after "Clear All Allocations"
**Cause**: Timing issue in initialization order (now fixed)
**Solution**: System now properly sequences: calculate ‚Üí render timeline ‚Üí initialize drag-drop

### Incorrect Succession Timing
**Issue**: Growth periods vary illogically
**Cause**: Original logic added offsets incorrectly
**Solution**: Now uses per-succession harvest dates as baseline

### Bed Conflicts Not Detected
**Issue**: System allows invalid allocations
**Cause**: FarmOS API data not loading
**Solution**: Check FarmOS connection and API credentials

### Quick Forms Not Generating
**Issue**: URLs missing or incorrect
**Cause**: Allocation data not saved properly
**Solution**: Ensure succession is properly allocated to bed before generating forms

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
FARMOS_BASE_URL=https://your-farm.farmos.net
FARMOS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
FARMOS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

### Crop Timing Presets
Located in `SuccessionPlanningController::getCropTimingPresets()`:
- Transplant days (seed to transplant)
- Harvest days (seed to harvest)
- Yield period (harvest window)

### AI Integration
- Uses SymbiosisAI service for enhanced recommendations
- Fallback to crop-specific presets if AI unavailable
- Confidence scoring for AI suggestions
