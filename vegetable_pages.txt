reserve the right to make an additional charge to cover the costs of
any specific requirements, such as having a product treated to order.
If you have a particular request for treated or untreated seed please

natural seed, except for the majority of the F1 brassica and F1 carrot

both graded and natural seed, and these are shown in the catalogue. In
addition to this, we have the capability to grade most of our products
to order, depending upon the product and quantity concerned. If you
need graded seed please contact us with your requirements and we will
be pleased to quote a price.

Organic

organic seed

Our seed is produced on farms which have been
officially authorised as meeting all the required
organic standards. The seed crops are grown on
soil which has taken at least five years to reach
the required standard and the crops themselves
are hand maintained and weeded without the use
of artificial chemicals in the form of herbicides,
pesticides or fertilisers. The seed is harvested using traditional methods
and there are no chemicals used in the seed cleaning process. The
seed is inspected for quality and authenticity by the organic governing
body in the country of origin and is then packed in a non-chemical
environment. All our organic seed is certified by the Soil Association.

Jackpot Series

Jackpot is a range of dwarf runner
beans that produce wonderfully
bushy, free-flowering plants that
require no support and will not grow
higher than 50cm making them
perfect for patio containers or the
front of the flower border. Jackpot
sets masses of tender delicious pods
which should be picked regularly to
ensure continuous flowering and
further pod development. They have
been carefully bred under British
conditions to ‘set’ very freely and
easily to ensure big crops of quality
tasty beans whatever the weather.

Beet (Leaf)
This is an extremely versatile
crop, becoming very popular in
salad leaf mixtures. Perpetual
spinach is also popular as a
long-term crop providing a high

directions as for beetroot. 40100 seeds per gram.

Harvest for leaf and stem
production. Celery flavoured
stalks and spinach-like leaves for
summer and autumn harvest.

VCE45 Green Soup

Red Soup

Cover crops and green manures
are plants grown to improve soil
structure, improve the nutrient
content of the soil, supress weed
development, reduce soil erosion
and reduce the incidence of some
pests, such as nematodes. The
term cover crop is often used for
seed mixes while green manures
are often referred to as straight
products. The term catch crop is
also used, but essentially they all
do the same job. These products
can be incorporated into a crop
rotation programme.
The choice of product will
depend upon local climate and
soil type, time of year, length
of gap in production, the aim of
the treatment and the follow on
crop.

A quickly establishing green manure
that can help reduce Potato Cyst
Nematodes when turned in. Also

The advantages of growing
onions from sets, rather than
from seed, are that there is a
shorter time to maturity, less
sensitivity to soil types and a
lower incidence of pest and
disease.
In addition to the popular variety
Sturon, we have put together a
range of top quality commercial
varieties to bring you the latest
breeding enhancements.
Approx. 180-200 bulbs per kilo.

Planting

Space 10cm (in row) x 25cm
(between rows). Plant onions
so that the tip of the bulb is
just visible above the soil. Best
results acheived from planting
mid March to mid April. Planting
into cold wet ground can cause
bolting so do not plant too early.
Heat treatments are used to kill
the flower embryo this prevents
bolting in early plantings.

Our bulbs

Our bulbs are produced in the
UK to ensure that they are
ideally suited to UK growing
conditions. All bulbs supplied are
within the size range of 14/21,
however we aim to grade them
to a more precise specification
where possible, e.g. 17/21.
Most set bulbs are lifted in the
early autumn but need to dry
and mature in order to achieve
the best results. We therefore
recommend delivery of bulbs
from mid-March onwards. If you
require delivery earlier than this
then please contact us for advice
on availability and suitability.
Please order by early March.

First Earlies

Potatoes remain one of the most
popular and productive crops
grown by amateur and professional
alike, and continue to be a staple
part of most diets. Potatoes can be
grown in almost any soil type, and
are ideal for ‘cleaning up’ previously
uncropped land. Potatoes can also
be grown in containers.

A very early, modern scraper,
suitable for growing in containers,
under polythene or glass, and field
production. Oval shape, cream
coloured flesh and good flavour.
Moderate blight resistance and high
scab resistance. Little discolouration
when cooked, fairly firm flesh.
Suitable for boiling and salad use.

Potato types

Cultivation terms

Chitting: when delivered lay
tubers out in tray with rose end
(most eyes) uppermost. Keep in
frost free, light room until sprouts
form (normally after 6 weeks).

Earthing-up

When the haulm (foliage) is
approximately 20cm tall draw up
soil around stem to form a flat ridge.
Earthing-up improves drainage and
growing environment for the plant
giving a much improved yield.
Earthing-up is also essential for
reducing greening.

Courgette

The courgette crop has recently
benefited from the increased
interest in gourmet cooking.
Courgette flowers and yellow
fruited varieties also fulfil a
specialist demand from the
restaurant market, while recently
introduced top quality round
courgettes add extra interest. Very
prolific, cost-effective croppers.
Can be grown early or late under
glass to extend the season, when
there is a price premium. 5-7
seeds per gram. Sow from early
April to early June, at 3.5-5kg per
hectare. Space at 60-120 by 90150cm, giving a plant population of
around 5,000-18,000 per hectare.
Harvest from July onwards.
The majority of the varieties
listed as courgettes can also
be used to produce marrows,
however we recommend the use
of the varieties listed for marrow
production to achieve the best
results.

Sweetcorn is also suitable for use
as young plant sales for the home
gardener. Germinates at between
18oC and 30oC. Sow April to June,

2) Sugar enhanced (se)
3) Super sweet (sh2)
