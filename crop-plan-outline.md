# Crop Plan Outline for 50-Family CSA (2026)

## Overview

This comprehensive crop plan outlines a 47-week schedule for a 50-family CSA operation producing approximately 3 kg/box (0.8–1 kg roots + 2–2.2 kg other vegetables, 10–12 items/week outside hunger gap). The plan covers February 1, 2026 through December 20, 2026, with focus on succession planting, bed allocation, and storage strategies to minimize buy-in requirements.

**Key Features:**
- Hunger gap management (Weeks 1–9, 44–47): Stored/overwinter crops dominant
- Spring ramp-up (Weeks 10–17): Transition from storage to fresh production
- Peak season (Weeks 18–35): Maximum diversity and yield
- Autumn storage (Weeks 36–43): Build reserves for winter
- Propagation timing: 2–6 weeks for short crops, 6–8 weeks for long crops
- Successions every 2–4 weeks for quick crops

## Buy-In Plan

### Overview
For 50 families at ~1 kg roots/box (to round up from 0.8 kg homegrown), weekly need = 50 kg roots. Homegrown ~40 kg/week avg (higher autumn ~60 kg, lower hunger gap ~20 kg). Total buy-in: ~10 kg/week avg (~470 kg/year). Focus on organic carrots/parsnips/salsify (sandy soil strengths, but winter gap). Source locally/seasonal to keep costs ~£1.50–2/kg wholesale (£7–10/week total).

### Seasonal Quantities

| Season | Weeks | Homegrown Roots (kg/wk) | Needed (kg/wk) | Buy-In (kg/wk) | Key Crops to Buy | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Hunger Gap (Winter) | 1–9, 44–47 (16 wks) | 20 | 50 | 30 | Carrots, parsnips | Stored shortfall; buy bulk for clamps. Total: 480 kg. |
| Spring Transition | 10–17 (8 wks) | 30 | 50 | 20 | Beets, early carrots | Ramp-up; intercrop helps. Total: 160 kg. |
| Summer Peak | 18–35 (18 wks) | 50 | 50 | 0 | None | Surplus—sell extra if possible. Total: 0 kg. |
| Autumn Storage | 36–43 (8 wks) | 60 | 50 | -10 (surplus) | None | Overproduction; store for winter. Total: 0 kg. |
| **Annual Total** | **47 wks** | **~1,880 kg** | **2,350 kg** | **~470 kg** | - | Cost est. £700–940/year. Adjust via autumn storage. |
