Full 47-Week Schedule
Here's the expanded 47-week schedule in CSV-style markdown table format for your 50-family CSA (3 kg/box, ~0.8–1 kg roots + 2–2.2 kg other veg, 10–12 items/week outside hunger gap). Dates are for 2026 (Feb 1 start). Columns: Week, Start Date, Sowing/Propagation (in prop area, trays est.), Transplant/Plant (beds/areas), Harvest (key items, kg est. for 50 boxes), Est. Items, Notes (incl. buy-in triggers). Patterns: Hunger gap (Wks 1–9, 44–47: stored/overwinter focus); spring ramp (Wks 10–17); peak (18–35); autumn store (36–43). Propagation: 2–6 wks for short crops (e.g., lettuce 2wks), 6–8 wks for long (tomatoes). Successions every 2–4 wks for quick crops.

Text-Based Bed Maps
Here's a simple text-based visual layout for your blocks, tunnels, and extra areas. Each block is a 4x4 grid (16 beds, numbered left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Symbols: R=Roots (e.g., carrots/parsley), L=Leafy/Salads, B=Brassicas (plugs), C=Cucurbits/Solanaceae, G=Legumes, H=Herbs, O=Overwinters, Cov=Clover cover. Intercrops noted as +R. Tunnels as rows. Extras as blocks.

Buy-In Plan
For 50 families at ~1 kg roots/box (to round up from 0.8 kg homegrown), weekly need = 50 kg roots. Your homegrown ~40 kg/week avg (higher autumn ~60 kg, lower hunger gap ~20 kg). Total buy-in: ~10 kg/week avg (~470 kg/year). Focus on organic carrots/parsnips/salsify (your sandy soil strengths, but gap in winter). Source locally/seasonal to keep costs ~£1.50–2/kg wholesale (£7–10/week total).
