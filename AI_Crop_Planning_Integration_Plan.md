# AI Crop Planning Integration Plan

## 1. Location/UI
- Integrate AI features into the admin panel, where crop planning and management are performed.
- Add an "Ask AI" button on all admin pages for easy access.

## 2. Data Access
- AI will have full access to farmOS and admin data.
- Future integration will include real-time sensor and irrigation data from the farm.
- AI will pick up harvest logs in farmOS and input stock into the shop.

## 3. User Interaction
- "Ask AI" button available on all admin pages.
- Some jobs/actions may require approval by management/admin before being applied.

## 4. AI Model/Logic
- Use Python for AI logic and service.
- Start with rule-based logic, expand to ML/AI as data grows.
- Use frameworks like FastAPI for the Python service.

## 5. Security
- Restrict AI features to logged-in admin staff only.
- Plan for future role-based permissions for different staff roles.

## 6. Integration
- Full REST API for farmOS and MWF integration.
- Develop a WordPress/WooCommerce plugin for shop integration.
- AI will analyze sales trends and adjust crop plans/stock accordingly.

## 7. Deployment
- Run the Python AI service on the same server as the Laravel admin.
- Plan for logging and monitoring of AI actions for transparency and debugging.

## Next Steps
- Define the first set of AI features (e.g., suggest crop plans, automate harvest logs, sync stock to WooCommerce).
- Decide on the communication method between Laravel and Python (REST API recommended).
- Start with a simple "Ask AI" interface, then expand automation as confidence grows.

This plan can be updated as the project evolves. Revisit before major implementation steps.
