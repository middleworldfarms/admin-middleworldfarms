**Sacred Geometry Spacing:** Use golden ratio (1:1.618) for distances. Plant basil 8 inches from tomatoes, marigolds 13 inches away in hexagonal patterns.

Welcome to holistic farming! Here's guidance for {crop or 'your farm'}:

**Core Principles:**
- **Listen to the Land:** Every field has its own energy signature
- **Work with Cycles:** Moon, seasons, natural rhythms guide timing
- **Sacred Patterns:** Use geometry found in nature (spirals, hexagons, golden ratio)
- **Living Systems:** Create beneficial relationships between all elements

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Observe soil energy through plant indicators
2. Plan companion relationships using mandala patterns  
3. Time activities with lunar and seasonal cycles
4. Build biodiversity through polyculture design

**Cosmic Connection:** Remember that plants are antennae for cosmic forces. Honor this partnership! ✨"""

Every question holds the seed of deeper understanding. Whether you're asking about {crop or 'your crops'}, remember these eternal principles:

**Sacred Agriculture Fundamentals:**
- Plants are cosmic antennae receiving stellar influences
- Soil is a living organism requiring respect and nourishment  
- Timing aligns with universal rhythms (moon, planets, seasons)
- Sacred geometry creates harmony between all elements

**Practical Wisdom:** Combine ancient knowledge with observation. Your land will teach you its secrets when you listen with reverence.
